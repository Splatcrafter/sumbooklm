 * <h2>Why the Kind Is Kept</h2>
 * The two kinds are acquired differently, are parsed by different components and are presented
 * differently. Keeping the distinction on the source itself is what allows all three to decide
 * without inspecting the origin string and guessing what it is.
 *
 * <h2>Persistence</h2>
 * The constants are persisted by name rather than by ordinal, so that the order of the declarations
 * below carries no meaning for stored data.
